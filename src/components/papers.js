            The annual conference of the International Society for Music
            Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum
            on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing
            music-related data. The 23rd ISMIR conference welcomes contributions
            related to any aspect of music information research, including
            foundations and theories for music processing, analysis, algorithms,
            evaluation, and applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl">
            ISMIR is a truly interdisciplinary research community, involving
            researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and
            professionals from various disciplines such as computer science,
            electrical engineering, musicology, cognitive science, and library
            and information sciences. The ISMIR conference provides a venue for
            the exchange of ideas, issues, results, and perspectives among
            different profiles of people working with music and computing in a
            broad sense.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl">
            In addition to established research topics and tasks, ISMIR always
            welcomes brave new ideas and challenges. Submissions of novel
            music-related topics, tasks, and applications are highly encouraged
            to broaden the scope of ISMIR. ISMIR also has a tradition of
            publishing open datasets and open-source projects to enhance the
            scientific reproducibility, though ISMIR accepts submissions using
            proprietary datasets and implementations that are not sharable.
            ISMIR thus respects the diversity of academic disciplines,
            backgrounds, and approaches.

            The accepted papers will be presented at the conference in a format

            Special Call for Papers: Cultural and Social Diversity in MIR

          <p className="text-xl">
            The research carried out in MIR nowadays does not reflect the rich
            variety of the world’s music traditions. MIR studies are mostly
            focused on international mainstream popular music, Western art music
            and other styles mainly based on tonal principles and global
            consumption practices. From ISMIR we want to promote the study of
            still under-represented music traditions in MIR. These traditions
            might not only present music characteristics that would require
            novel approaches even for standard MIR tasks, but can represent
            under-studied musical functions and communities. In this regard, we
            also encourage the study of new groups of music makers and users, as
            well as the development of tools that benefit beyond mainstream
            music communities. Equally, we encourage studies from a
            cross-cultural perspective that cater to this musical and cultural
            diversity. To submit to this track, authors should indicate this in
            the main submission form. These submissions will follow the same
            submission process and requirements described below, but dedicated
            meta-reviewers will be selected to oversee their review. An award
            will be given to the best paper accepted within this special call.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl">
            <span className="italic">Full paper review: </span>
            Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and a
            program committee member (meta-reviewer) who will overview the
            process and write a meta-review with a recommendation. The
            Scientific Program Chairs will make the final decision based on that
            recommendation.

            <span className="italic">Preprints: </span>To maintain the

            protect our double-blind review process, authors need to make sure
            they do not promote their work in any way during the review process
            (social media, blog, mailing-list, etc.), since this may prevent
