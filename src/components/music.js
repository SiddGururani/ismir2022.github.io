          This year, music from any genre and in any formats is invited for
          submission. However, to make it a good fit for a hybrid format and
          make it more interesting, we propose the following themes that
          participants are encouraged to explore, but of course not limit to:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-xl list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Recorded Ensemble:</span> Participants
            form teams to record ensemble performances to submit. (i) Networked
            offline — performers in different locations can pre-record each
            track and assemble it with others’ tracks by post editing, to
            perform as if the performances were played at the same time; (ii)
            Networked live — participants can also select to do a live
            performance using specialized audio streaming software (like
            Jacktrip, Soundjack) providing the audio to a multiple screen chat
            application like Zoom. The accepted submissions will be played back
            on-site as well as broadcast live.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Live Ensemble:</span> Participants form
            teams to compose ensemble performances that can be performed live. A
            recording of the edited ensemble has to be submitted for review,
            however, the accepted works will be performed live on-site and
            broadcast live.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Creative Visuals for Music:</span>{" "}
            Participants are encouraged to apply creative visual effects to
            accompany music. This includes but is not limited to AI-powered
            visual effects (e.g., facial distortion, video filtering) synced
            with music contents, animations or fictions, body performances,
            movements and gestures, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Adaptations to Post-pandemic Era:</span>{" "}
            Participants are encouraged to create musical/sound art works that
            emphasizes the adaptations innovated during the mandated home studio
            setups with limited resources.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-2xl font-bold">Concert</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          The concert program will be held in a hybrid format consisting of live
          performance for the on-site attendees and a live online streaming for
          the virtual attendees. Live comments will be enabled to encourage
          interactions. For broadcast of pre-recorded videos, performers are
          expected to be present to interact with audiences in the live chat
          window.

        <p className="text-2xl font-bold">Submission guidelines</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          The submission of music works should consist of:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-xl list-disc list-inside">

            form of program notes (text) and technical rider (pdf)
          </li>
          <li>
            Video/audio performance of the piece, as .mp4, .mov, .wav, .aif,
            .flac format with file size &lt; 100MB or an online link
            (preferably).
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                For non-live performance, the video file will be broadcast
                during the concert.
              </li>
              <li>
                For live performance, please also submit a video/audio of a

          After notification of acceptance, all participants have a chance to
          further edit the uploaded material to make a performance-ready
          submission. The video should be self-explanatory with some
          post-processed titles and subtitles, since there will be no commenter
          during the broadcast. Original audio submissions should be converted
          to video format with a meaningful visual component.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          Only one submission per participant will be accepted. Pieces have to
          be shorter than 10 minutes. The submission is not anonymous. The
          proposals and video performances will be submitted through the CMT
          system for a light review. There is no guarantee that all submissions
          will be accepted for the program. Please note the submission proposal
          is for informative purposes for the selection and will not be included
          in the conference proceedings. The artist must hold the copyright of
          submitted materials to be used in ISMIR 2022.

          already ISMIR paper authors and have registered for the conference,
