          The New-to-ISMIR paper mentoring program is designed for members new
          to ISMIR (early stage researchers in MIR or researchers from allied
          fields who wish to consider submitting their work to an ISMIR
          conference) to share their advanced-stage work-in-progress ISMIR paper
          drafts with senior members of the ISMIR community (mentors) to obtain
          focused reviews and constructive feedback. The program supplements the
          generic submission guidelines. The program is being run as a pilot in
          2022, closely aligned with the ISMIR 2022 paper submissions deadlines.

        <ul className="text-xl list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            The mentorship program encourages early stage researchers or
            researchers from other allied fields who wish to submit their work
            to ISMIR conference to share their advanced stage work-in-progress
            ISMIR paper submissions with senior members of the ISMIR community
            to obtain focused reviews and constructive feedback. The topics of
            the paper are expected to be in alignment with the topics of ISMIR
            conferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mentees are expected to apply to the program with a tentative
            abstract and submit an advanced-stage draft of the paper by the
            published deadlines (see below Important Dates).
          </li>
          <li>
            A mentor will be assigned to each mentee paper in the program and
            will provide a detailed review and constructive feedback to improve
            the work and the paper quality for suitability in an ISMIR
            conference. The mentor will maintain confidentiality of the
            discussions and the unpublished work as agreed with the mentees. The
            mentor will be available for up to two cycles of review/feedback on
            the mentee paper revisions, and up to two discussion meetings (up to
            an hour each).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mentee authors get one cycle of review (authors submit, mentors
            provide a review) but are optionally encouraged to participate in an
            additional cycle where the authors incorporate the suggestions and
            mentor reviews the revised paper. Mentees are expected to provide
            additional information on their work, if requested by the mentor to
            provide better feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            We strongly encourage the mentored papers to be revised based on the
            feedback and submitted to the upcoming ISMIR 2022 conference. All
            mentored papers, if submitted to ISMIR 2022, will go through the
            usual process of review without any exceptions. Both mentors and
            mentees agree to clearly declare conflict of interests when the
            mentored papers are submitted to the ISMIR conference to facilitate
            double-blind review process.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this pilot program, we will be able to support a limited number
            of papers for mentorship due to capacity constraints. If we receive
            more requests than we can support, we will prioritize papers
            considering authorsâ€™ needs and/or topics that fall under the special
            call for papers.

            Q. How many papers are supported in the pilot program in 2022? Is
            there a chance that my application for mentorship might not be
            accommodated?
            <br></br>
            <span className="italic">
              A. Since the program is in a pilot stage in 2022, the number of
              papers we support is limited by our current organisational
              capacity and availability of mentors. It may be possible that not
              all applications are accommodated if we receive a large number of
              requests. However, authors will know regarding acceptance of their
              applications before submitting papers to the program.

            Q. Who will be my mentor if I apply to the program?
            <br></br>
            <span className="italic">
              A. Invited senior members from the MIR community have been kind
              enough to volunteer for the program. The mentors and mentees will
              be matched based on the topic of papers as chosen during
              submission and introduced to each other.

          </li>
          <li className="space-x-3">
            Q. If I incorporate all feedback from the mentor into my paper, will
            my paper be accepted for publication in the ISMIR conference? Is
            there a different review process for the mentored papers?
            <br></br>
            <span className="italic">
              A. All mentored papers will go through the same review process as
              all other papers submitted to an ISMIR conference. There is no
              assurance that a mentored paper will be accepted to the
              conference.
