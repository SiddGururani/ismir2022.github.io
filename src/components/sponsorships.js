          The annual conference of the International Society for Music
          Information Retrieval (ISMIR) will be held in Bengaluru, India from
          December 4-8, 2022. ISMIR represents the largest body of scholars,
          researchers and practitioners in the field of music information
          retrieval (MIR), an interdisciplinary research area concerned with
          processing, analysing, organising and accessing music information. The
          scope of ISMIR extends across the fields of computer science,
          musicology, cognitive science, library & information science and
          electrical engineering. With its strong research and application
          leanings, the ISMIR conference has traditionally been supported by
          prominent names in the music industry across the world.
