          ISMIR 2022 will take place in a hybrid format, with a mix of in-person and virtual presenters and attendees. 
          The format is intended to give all attendees an opportunity to interact with all presenting authors. Note 
           however that because of time zone differences, not all interactions will be synchronous.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg"> 
         Similar to previous editions, the entire conference (apart from the tutorials) is single-track and all the scientific 
          program sessions in the schedule will be live broadcast. Some of the sessions (as separately indicated) will be 
          interactive for remote participants to participate with questions/comments. At the outset, we request you to please read

                We will use Zoom meetings in the conference, which ensures a two-way communication is possible and

          <p className="text-xl font-bold">Inclusive Hybrid mode</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Given that the conference is hybrid with a large portion of participants attending the conference remotely, 
              the conference aims to be inclusive to all participants, especially to remote attendees during the conference.
              When possible, we will first seek questions/comments from remote attendees during plenary sessions, given that 
              in-person attendees will have the opportunity to meet with the speakers at the venue for further questions. 
              We request all participants to be considerate about remote attendeesâ€™ time zone differences while engaging 
              with them via asynchronous interaction. We request participants to make efforts to include any remote attendees 
              who are desirous of participating in any discussions during the conference.

          <p className="text-xl font-bold">Recording and Archival</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            All sessions of the scientific program (tutorials, paper presentations, all plenary sessions, opening, closing sessions and ISMIR music program) 
            will be recorded and made available on conference slack for offline viewing. The recordings will be available to registered conference 
            participants until 19 Dec 2022.

          <ul className="list-disc text-lg list-inside">
            <li>Please make sure you mute yourself while not speaking during a session.</li>
            <li>We encourage you to switch on video when you ask questions.</li>
            <li>Though the conference is hybrid, a majority of events happen during the day time in India. 
              While we understand the timezone might not be convenient for all attendees, we encourage you to 
              participate live in all sessions of the conference for the best experience.</li>
