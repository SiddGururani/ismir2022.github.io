LBD session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers. This page will soon be updated with other details. Stay tuned!</p>
